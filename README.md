# 🚀 Agastya — Autonomous Systems Club, NIT Jalandhar

**Agastya** is the **Autonomous Systems & UAV Innovation Club** at **Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar (NITJ)**.
We bring together passionate students from diverse engineering disciplines to **design, build, and operate intelligent autonomous aerial systems** through hands-on learning, innovation, and collaborative engineering.

At Agastya, ideas evolve into **flight-ready solutions**. Members engage in end-to-end development — from **aerodynamics and airframe design** to **control systems, embedded electronics, mission software, simulation, and real-world flight testing**. Our ecosystem emphasizes practical experimentation, structured documentation, and industry-grade engineering workflows.

### ✈️ What We Do

* Autonomous UAV & Robotics Development
* Embedded Systems & Control Engineering
* Simulation, Testing & Flight Operations
* Research Collaboration & Technical Competitions
* Workshops, Mentorship & Peer Learning

We cultivate a **professional, safety-first culture** focused on innovation, leadership, and reproducible engineering practices. Agastya empowers students to move beyond classrooms and contribute to the future of autonomous technology.
